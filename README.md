wheel.coffee is a collection of javascript functions that reinvent the wheel, but in coffee script :)

The docs are built with [docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco), which when building from the Cakefile, requires docco to be installed globally: 

    npm -g install docco

The minified javascript is built with [uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS), which when building from the Cakefile, requires uglifyjs to be installed globally: 

    npm -g install uglify-js
